# Development Process Documentation

## LLM Usage

### Code Generation
**Prompt:** "Generate an initial code structure for a RESTful API in Express using TypeScript, including endpoints for GET /tasks, POST /task, PUT /task/{id}, and DELETE /task/{id}. Make sure to include basic error handling and a Task model."

**Integration:** The generated code was integrated directly into the project, with minor adjustments to fit the project structure.

### Testing
**Prompt:** "Generate unit tests for the above Express API using Jest and Supertest."

**Integration:** The generated tests were added to the `src/test` directory and validated by running `npm test`.

### Documentation
**Prompt:** "Generate API documentation for the above Express API, including endpoint descriptions and usage examples."

**Integration:** The generated documentation was added to the `README.md` file.

### Deployment
**Prompt:** "Generate a deployment script for the above API using Docker and a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions."

**Integration:** The generated Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflow were added to the project and tested for functionality.

### Monitoring
**Prompt:** "Generate a script to set up basic monitoring for the above API using Prometheus and Grafana."

**Integration:** The generated Docker Compose and Prometheus configuration files were added to the project and validated by running `docker-compose up`.

### Iterative Improvement
**Prompt:** "Generate code to add a new feature to the above API: a PATCH /task/{id} endpoint to update only specific fields of a task."

**Integration:** The generated code was added to the project and validated by creating new tests and running `npm test`.

## Challenges
- Ensuring the generated code met the specific requirements of the project.
- Refining the prompts to get the desired output from the LLM.
- Validating and testing LLM-generated content to ensure correctness.

## Reflections
Using LLMs significantly accelerated the development process by providing a solid foundation for code, tests, documentation, and deployment configurations. However, careful validation and refinement were necessary to ensure the quality and correctness of the final product.
